# Advent of Code 2022
This is a Go implementation of the solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your system.

### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/techdufus/AdventOfCode.git
```
## Running the code
To run the code for the answers, simply run the `main.go` file at the root of this directory
```bash
go run main.go
```
This will run the code and print the answers to the puzzles for the completed days to the terminal.

## Running the tests
To run the tests for the code, at the root of the 2022 directory, run the following command:
```bash
go test ./...
```
This will run all the tests for the code and print the results to the terminal.
